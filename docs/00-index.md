## Do-s and Don't-s

### DO

- **Use these components** – These components are to help you style your site, so do use them liberally!
- **Outline your document correctly** – Define your document structure first. You can check the document outline with browser extensions such as [HeadingsMap for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/headingsmap/flbjommegcjonpdmenkdiocclhjacmbi/related?hl=en).

### DON'T

- **Don't let design dictate your document outline - and vice-versa** – Get your content sorted first, apply the components' `class`es after that.
- **Don't apply inline styles** – You'll be mocked and shamed during the PR review. There is one exception for defining background images on the Slice component, but other than that it's a **big** no-no.
- **Don't write extra styles** – If you're doing that, then there's a chance something's missing from the pattern library. Find a designer and maybe another dev, and talk it out.
