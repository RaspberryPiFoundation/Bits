## Spacings
Paddings and margins are all in multiples of 5px from 5px to 50px for standard usage.

## Responsive breakpoints
| name | size |
|:--|:--|
| xs | < 576px |
| sm | >= 576px |
| md | >= 768px |
| lg | >= 992px |
| xl | >= 1200px |

Code should be written for `xs` first, then modified using the `sm`, `md`, `lg` and `xl` breakpoints where appropriate.

## Fonts
