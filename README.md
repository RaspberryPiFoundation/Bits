Uses `linklocal`

* Using iota-react for all the super low-level stuff - all colors,
  paddings/margins/font families/text styles/grid system all done for us
* Should be as few styles defined at component level as possible
* Everything is functional and stateless
* shelving idea of doc site for now - Gatsby was playing up anyway
* most important thing is this is built and ready to use - has to happen quickly
* shelving docs site will mean time can be spent on tests
* docs will still exist in the form of README files in each component
* docs site can happen as a future block of work/web week task
* won't be providing compiled assets - React is the more likely use case for now
* if we need these styles in older sites then we can look at a build tool that sticks it on a CDN somewhere with version number
